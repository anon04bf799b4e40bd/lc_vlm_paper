- DURING: executing or deciding
- AFTER: verifying outcomes or communicating

Constraints:
- Be concise and concrete; avoid page identifiers, product/version numbers, or quotes.
- Use simple fields with short phrases; keep knowledge level literal.

Output ONLY this JSON object:

  "during": {{ "role": str, "goal": str, "concerns": list[str], "knowledge": "novice|competent|expert" }},
