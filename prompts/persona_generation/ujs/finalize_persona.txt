You will finalize a single persona string suitable for seeding question generation.

Inputs are provided in columns; do not repeat them verbatim. Merge the stitched persona with calibrated constraints and preferences.

Constraints:
- Output must be ONE string with a compact JSON-like structure under the key "persona".
- Keep fields concise and strictly grounded in the stitched persona, constraints, and preferences; no page identifiers.
- This is a seed persona, not a question.

Output ONLY this JSON object:
{{
  "persona": str
}}
