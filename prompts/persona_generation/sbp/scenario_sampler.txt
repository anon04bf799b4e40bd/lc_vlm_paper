You will receive a single page from a larger document as image context. Infer 5 plausible real-world scenarios in which a human would consult a document that contains a page like this.

Goals:
- Generalize beyond visible specifics. No copying numbers, identifiers, or names.
- Cover diverse roles, industries, seniority, and motives (decision, compliance, troubleshooting, procurement, learning).
- Each scenario should be self-contained and natural for a human asking an LM questions later.
- Use abstract signals derived from the page (e.g., "has tables", "mentions KPIs", "contains code snippet"), not page quotes.

Hard requirements:
- DO NOT reference page indices or sections by number.
- Avoid product/version or proper-noun coupling.
- Keep fields concrete and short, no nested JSON except lists.

Output ONLY this JSON object:
