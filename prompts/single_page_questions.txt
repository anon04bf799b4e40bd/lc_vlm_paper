Your goal is to generate a list of {n_questions} different questions for the reader in the same language as the provided pages.

Quality questions are difficult and not overly long (often less than 2 sentences).

{side_by_side_prefix}
{side_by_side}
Here is the output format, provide nothing except this:
{{
    "questions": list[str],
    "page_word_count": int,
    "is_table_of_contents": bool,
    "is_bibliography": bool,
    "not_suitable_for_questions": bool
}}
