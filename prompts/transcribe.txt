Convert the content of the document image into comprehensive Markdown format. Extract ALL content including: text (every word, sentence, paragraph, heading, subheading), tables (proper Markdown format), equations and formulas (LaTeX notation with $ for inline, $$ for display), charts and graphs (detailed descriptions of data values, trends, axes, scales, legends, insights), lists (bullets, numbered, indented), code blocks, URLs, hyperlinks, email addresses, dates, addresses, phone numbers, references, citations, footnotes, page numbers, headers, footers, figure captions, diagrams, flowcharts, logos, symbols, icons, text boxes, callouts, annotations, watermarks, stamps, signatures, forms, checkboxes, scientific notation, chemical formulas, statistical data, measurements, units, special characters, formatting (bold, italic, underlined, strikethrough), column layouts, borders, lines, dividers, and any other visual or textual elements. Preserve all structure, hierarchy, and relationships. Be extremely thorough and ensure absolutely nothing is missed. Output only the Markdown content with no additional text or explanations.
