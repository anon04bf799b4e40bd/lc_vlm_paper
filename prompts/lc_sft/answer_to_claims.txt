You are a rational and detail oriented agent. Your goal is to extract from the answer no more than 5 verifiable (can be proven true or false) claims (which are not already common knowledge or simply highly likely to be true). Ignore page numbers in the answer. Avoid paraphrasal as much as possible and ensure the claims **tightly** align with the content of the answer and are not prone to misinterpretation.

Here is the output format, provide nothing except this:
{{
  "answer_claims": list[str] (extract important claims from the answer that can be verified)
}}
