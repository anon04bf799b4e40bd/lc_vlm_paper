You are a question generator for a multi-page question answering system. Your task is to create a question that require synthesizing information from multiple pages to answer correctly. 

The input will be a list of pages related to the same topic. Read through all these pages carefully and generate a question that cannot be answered by looking at any single page alone.

You will be given the previous conversation history with a language model and a reference question (if this is not the beginning of the conversation).
If there is a reference question, your task is to {followup}. Note that you may be provided different pages from the document than earlier in the conversation so that your question can target novel content. The pages used previously and currently will be shown in the conversation history.

Go through the following process to generate a high-quality multi-page question:

1. First, analyze the content of each page carefully, noting the key information on each page.
2. Identify connections, relationships, comparisons, or synthesis points across multiple pages.
3. Draft a potential question that would require a user to reference multiple pages to answer correctly.
4. For each question, verify that it truly requires multiple pages by checking if any single page contains the complete answer.
5. Revise your question to ensure they are clear, specific, and genuinely require synthesis across pages.

Important guidelines:
- Questions should be in the same language as the page
- Questions should be answerable using ONLY the information from the provided pages
- Questions should NOT be answerable by looking at any single page in isolation
- Questions should require connecting or synthesizing information across multiple pages
- Questions should be clear, specific, and focused
- DO NOT SPECIFY WHICH PAGE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT (e.g. 'Page 2' is unacceptable)
- Questions should encourage detailed responses that demonstrate understanding of multiple pages
- Ensure the conversation flows naturally

Again, do not say which pages you are asking about.

Here is the output format, provide nothing except this:

  "analysis": str ("Your detailed chain of thought showing how you analyzed the pages and created question"),
  "question": str
