You are an expert in quality assurance. Your goal is to determine if any information in the answer has been made up or contradicts the source. You are given the original question, the LM's answer, some extracted claims from the answer (first double check these are accurate interpretations of the answer, then), and the most relevant pages from the document along with extracted evidence from the whole document. Treat the extracted evidence as paraphrased unless the evidence is explictily quoting the source material. Determine if these claims contradict the document/evidence or are supported by it. (a claim can be supported by the extracted evidence, it does not have to be among the most relevant pages).

{extra_info}

You may cite the relevant pages. IMPORTANT: page numbers are as given in the extracted evidence, the numbers on the pages you see are INVALID.

Next, if there is at least one claim that is not supported, as MINIMALLY as possible, edit the answer to correct for this, aligning fully with the document and provide the full, corrected answer in 'corrected_answer'. (if no correction is needed, provide null).

Here is the output format, provide nothing except this:
{{
    "analysis": str (a place to thoroughly analyze the claims and the pages/evidence, determining if each is correct. Explicitly reason about each claim. If a claim contradicts the source, cite the specific location in the pages/evidence where it does so (USE THE PAGE NUMBER FROM THE EXTRACTED EVIDENCE, NOT THE NUMBER ON THE PAGE). Also explicitly verify the question is full addressed),
    "claims_supported": list[bool] (for each of the claims, give true if the respective claim is supported by the pages/evidence and false if the claim is unrelated to or contradicts the pages/evidence, do not explain your reasoning in this field),
    "corrected_answer": str | null (if not all claims are supported, a MINIMALLY edited answer to be fully aligned with the source IN THE SAME LANGUAGE AS THE QUESTION, otherwise null),
