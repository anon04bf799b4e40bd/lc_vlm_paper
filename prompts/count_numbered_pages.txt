Use the scratchpad to consider whether or not the page number which indicates the position in the single pdf document is visible on the page.
There may be other numbers on the page. List the candidate numbers in the scratchpad and then for each, determine if they are the actual page number.
Provide a final answer for whether or not the page number is visible.

Here is the output format, provide nothing except this:
{{
  "scratchpad": str,
  "is_page_number_visible": bool
}}
